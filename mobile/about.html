			<h1>How to use SimplyTasks</h1>
			<p>
				SimplyTasks is a simple monthly calendar with an integrated to-do list. Upon arrival on the site, you are greeted with a
				monthly calendar displaying the current month and a colour indication of the current date. You may go as far into the
				future or back into the past as you would like via the back (<) and forward (>) buttons. The Today button will take you
					directly back to the current month and year. On the right is the to-do list. The add (+) button will allow you to
					create a new to-do item. To delete tasks use the trash button.
